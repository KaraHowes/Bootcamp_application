      <p>
        To really define the meaning of HTTPS, we have to go back to good old HTTP.
       Hypertext Transfer Protocol &#40;HTTP&#41; is a protocol by which files &#40;be it HTML, JavaScript etc&#41;
       are sent in a network. For a simplified explanation of HTTP, clicky <a href="http://www.adrianworlddesign.com/Knowledge-Base/Web-Standards/Things-about-Hypertext/http-for-dummies">here.</a><div class=""></div>
      </p>

      <h2>
        So, what happens when we add an S?.....
      </h2>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/https.png" alt="A representation of HTTPS">
        
      </div>
      
      <p>
          In the simplest sense, the S in HTTPS stands for Secure. It is an 
          extension of HTTP which has been encrypted by Transport Layer Security &#40;TLS&#41;, which is nicely illustrated in the above <a href="https://www.primekey.com/wiki/what-does-https-stand-for/">Schematic</a>. It's main purpose is to ensure the privacy and 
          integrity of the data across the network. HTTPS sucessfuly prevents Man-in-the-Middle cyberattacks, as well as protecting against
          eavesdropping, by establishing a secure connection over an insecure network. TLS offers three-layers of <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/security/https">protection:</a>
          
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ol>
              <li> <span><b>Encryption</b></span> - The date is encryped to secure it from third-party listeners</li>
              <li> <span><b>Data Integrity</b></span> - Data can not be interferred with or corrupted</li>
              <li> <span><b>Authentication</b> </span> - proves that the user is communicating with the desired website.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>

      <p>
        Orignally, HTTPS was an expensive protocol to use, so was only utilised on secured payment
        transaction services. Now, however, the protocol is more prevalent and is used to maintain website authenticity and to 
        ensure web-browsing remains private. From a web-developers prospective, it is essential to obtain a security certificate, 
        which verifies the website belongs to an organisation.
